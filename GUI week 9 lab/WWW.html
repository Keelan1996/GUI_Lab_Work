 <h1>The World Wide Web</h1>
	
			<p class="myClass2">The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information
			space where documents and other web resources are identified by
			Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links,
			and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee"
			target="_blank"> Tim Berners-Lee</a> invented the World Wide Web in
			1989. He wrote the first <i>web browser</i> computer program in 1990
			while employed
			at <a href="https://home.cern/about" target="_blank">CERN</a> in
			Switzerland. The <i>Web browser</i> was released outside of
			<a href="https://home.cern/about" target="_blank">CERN</a> in 1991,
			first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and
			to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.</p>
			
			<p class="myClass">The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the
			Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to
			interact on the Internet. Web pages are primarily text documents
			formatted and annotated with the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
			In addition to the formatted text, web pages may contain images,
			video, audio and software components that are rendered in the user's
			<i>web browser</i> as coherent pages of multimedia content.</p>
			
			<p class="myClass2">Embedded hyperlinks permit the users to navigate between web
			pages. Multiple web pages with a common theme, a common domain name,
			or both, make up a website. Website content can largely be provided
			by the publisher, or interactively where users contribute content
			or the content depends upon the users or their actions. Websites
			may be mostly informative, primarily entertainment, or largely for
			commercial, governmental, or non-governmental organisation
			purposes</p>
