	    <p> <center> On the north side ache highway, three and a half miles east of Chambless Junction1, where old Route 66 crosses over the pink and grey 
		Precambrian granite core ache Marble Mountains, lies the ruins of what was once a gas station, cafe and garage known as Cadiz Summit or simply "Summit". 
		For forty-four years, from 1928 to 1972, a succession of owners operated this roadside business that catered to the needs of travelers on Route 66. 
		Today the site is empty and deserted except for some of the concrete foundations of the buildings that once stood and the walls of the garage 
		that arc emblazoned with graffiti in at least four languages.</center></p>

        <p><center>The Morgan family and the early days of Summit
         Cadiz Summit was first built by Thomas R. Morgan in 1928, 
        Tom ran a General Store in Amboy and his wife Frances focused on raising their three children, Cecil, Angela, and Tom Jr. 
        In early 1927, as he had done in previous years, Tom began gathering and stockpiling an assortment of fireworks in the store, intending to sell them for the 
        4,1-July celebrations later that summer. Unfortunately the store caught fire one</center></p>
